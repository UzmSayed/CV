                <p>I work in a product based M.N. company. My work is to verify products and systems for defects and make sure of industry standards and that client requirements are met. I see to it that our product is user friendly, has
                  understandable
                  features and is easily accessible. To give you an example - While submitting a form a “Submit” button is crucial else the user will not be sure if their form has been submitted, also it should be placed at the end of the form so
                  that it
                  is accessible, it should also be highlighted suitably so that it is detectable. Along with this I provide quality assurance expertise, attention to details, technical skills, time management, and making improvement suggestions</p>
